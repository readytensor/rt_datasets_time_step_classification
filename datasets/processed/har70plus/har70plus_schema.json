  "description": "The Human Activity Recognition 70+ (HAR70+) dataset is a professionally-annotated dataset containing 18 fit-to-frail older-adult subjects (70-95 years old) wearing two 3-axial accelerometers for around 40 minutes during a semi-structured free-living protocol. The sensors were attached to the right thigh and lower back. The purpose was to train machine learning models for human activity recognition on professionally-annotated accelerometer data of fit-to-frail older adults.
