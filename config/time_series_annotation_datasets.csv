time_series_annotation,12,har70plus,HAR70+,The HAR70+ dataset contains recordings of 18 older adult participants wearing two 3-axial Axivity AX3 accelerometers for around 40 minutes in a semi-structured free-living setting. The participants' age was between 70 and 95 years. Five of the 18 subjects used walking aids during data recording. One sensor was attached to the right front thigh and the other to the lower back. The provided sampling rate is 50Hz. Video recordings of a chest-mounted camera were used to annotate the performed activities frame-by-frame.,OTHER,label,Activity performed by the subject (1: walking  3: shuffling 4: stairs (ascending) 5: stairs (descending) 6: standing 7: sitting	8: lying),1,0,utf-8
time_series_annotation,13,eeg_eye_state,EEG Eye State,EEG Eye StateAll data is from one continuous EEG measurement with the Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset. The duration of the measurement was 117 seconds. The eye state was detected via a camera during the EEG measurement and added later manually to the file after analysing the video frames. '1' indicates the eye-closed and '0' the eye-open state. All values are in chronological order with the first measured value at the top of the data.,OTHER,eyeDetection,'1' indicates the eye-closed and '0' the eye-open state.,1,0,utf-8
