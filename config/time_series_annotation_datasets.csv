time_series_annotation,1,hmm_continuous,hmm_continuous,"The HMM Continuous Timeseries Dataset is a synthetic dataset generated using a Hidden Markov Model with continuous valued observations, designed for timeseries annotation and analysis tasks. Each sample features variable-length multivariate timeseries data with corresponding state labels, providing a complex and diverse testbed for advanced timeseries algorithms.",OTHER,label,Label for each time step in the sample,1,0,utf-8

time_series_annotation,3,har70plus,HAR70+,The HAR70+ dataset contains recordings of 18 older adult participants wearing two 3-axial Axivity AX3 accelerometers for around 40 minutes in a semi-structured free-living setting. The participants' age was between 70 and 95 years. Five of the 18 subjects used walking aids during data recording. One sensor was attached to the right front thigh and the other to the lower back. The provided sampling rate is 50Hz. Video recordings of a chest-mounted camera were used to annotate the performed activities frame-by-frame.,OTHER,label,Activity performed by the subject (1: walking  3: shuffling 4: stairs (ascending) 5: stairs (descending) 6: standing 7: sitting	8: lying),1,0,utf-8
time_series_annotation,4,eeg_eye_state,EEG Eye State,EEG Eye StateAll data is from one continuous EEG measurement with the Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset. The duration of the measurement was 117 seconds. The eye state was detected via a camera during the EEG measurement and added later manually to the file after analysing the video frames. '1' indicates the eye-closed and '0' the eye-open state. All values are in chronological order with the first measured value at the top of the data.,OTHER,eyeDetection,'1' indicates the eye-closed and '0' the eye-open state.,1,0,utf-8
time_series_annotation,5,emg_gestures,EMG Gestures,"For recording patterns, we used a MYO Thalmic bracelet worn on a userâ€™s forearm, and a PC with a Bluetooth receiver. The bracelet is equipped with eight sensors equally spaced around the forearm that simultaneously acquire myographic signals. The signals are sent through a Bluetooth interface to a PC. We present raw EMG data for 36 subjects while they performed series of static hand gestures.The subject performs two series, each of which consists of six (seven) basic gestures. Each gesture was performed for 3 seconds with a pause of 3 seconds between gestures.",OTHER,class,"the label of gestures (0 - unmarked data, 1 - hand at rest, 2 - hand clenched in a fist, 3 - wrist flexion,4 â€“ wrist extension, 5 radial deviations, 6 - ulnar deviations, 7 - extended palm (the gesture was not performed by all subjects).)",1,0,utf-8
time_series_annotation,6,pamap2,Physical Activity Monitoring,"The PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset contains data of 18 different physical activities (such as walking, cycling, playing soccer, etc.), performed by 9 subjects wearing 3 inertial measurement units and a heart rate monitor. The dataset can be used for activity recognition and intensity estimation, while developing and applying algorithms of data processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification.",OTHER,activity_id,"1: lying, 2: sitting, 3: standing , 4: walking, 5: running, 6: cycling, 7: Nordic walking, 9: watching TV, 10: computer work, 11: car driving, 12: ascending stairs, 13: descending stairs, 16: vacuum cleaning, 17: ironing, 18: folding laundry, 19: house cleaning, 20: playing soccer, 24: rope jumping, 0: other",1,0,utf-8
time_series_annotation,7,daily_weather,Daily Weather in 26 World Cities,"This dataset spans 3 years and includes daily weather measurements for 26 cities worldwide. It comprises 17 weather parameters, making it suitable for both multi-variate and single-series forecasting tasks. With data from January 2020 to December 2022, it's an ideal resource for forecasting the 'temperature' series while leveraging other weather measurements as potential exogenous factors.",DAILY,weather_descriptions,"[Cloudy, Partly cloudy, Sunny, Patchy rain possible, Overcast, Moderate rain at times, Moderate or heavy rain shower, Heavy rain at times, Light freezing rain, Moderate or heavy snow showers, Patchy moderate snow, Moderate snow]",1,0,utf-8
